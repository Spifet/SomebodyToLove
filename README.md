# SomebodyToLove
(MERN) A pet adoption website with user registration, login and adoption systems. Super Users (Admins) can add, remove and modify animals.

# About
The website's idea is to contribute to the fight for reducing the number of millions of pets that enter animal shelters every year. The website is equipped with all the necessary systems to adopt and foster a pet. Users register (and log in) to their account and access the catalog of available pets for adoption and/or foster. In addition, super users (admins) can add, remove and modify animals.

All pets are good for one's health, but adoptees offer an extra boost.
